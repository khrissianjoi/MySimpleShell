BACKGROUND PROCESS

  If you wish to be able to run a program and return to the command line prompt
  and be able to do more programs after launching that program. The addition of
  '&' (amperstand) at the end of each command line (eg. programname arg1 &)
  allows background execution of programs. MyShell allows you to do something 
  else after running a program that may take awhile.

INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTION

  > file
    The greater-than sign followed by a file allows the output of the command be 
    written in to the supplied file.If the file supplied is non-existant it will 
    create it and write its output, otherwise it will OVERWITE the contents of your
    supplied file with the output of the command. Output redirection redirects the 
    standard output to the terminal, into the specified file.


  >> file
    The double-greater-than sign followed by a file is similar to the single
    greater-than sign (> file). It APPENDS the output of the command to the supplied
    file.


  < file
    The less-than sign followed by a file allows the input of a command to be
    redirected from a file. Input redirection redirects the standard input (supplied 
    by you in the terminal) to the specified file.
